# Translation slightly varies from source text. "Ratelimited" has no direct translation, so it's been changed to simply "limited". Technically, "banned" has no direct translation, however some  english terms have been adopted into the language informally and are well known throughout the internet community, so I used the "spanified" version of it. There should be no issues understanding this word, however if there is, it can be changed to "blocked" or a similar word. Please let me know!
